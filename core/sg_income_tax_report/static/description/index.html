               IRAS encourages all employers to join the AIS for Employment Income. This scheme allows employers to electronically submit their employees' income information to IRAS. This information will be shown on the employees' electronic tax return and will be automatically included in their income tax assessments.</p>
        <newline/>
       <p>If you participate in the AIS for Employment Income, you do not need to issue Form IR8A, Appendix 8A, Appendix 8B and Form IR8S to your employees. However, you could provide your employees with a separate statement of earnings for their records.</p>
