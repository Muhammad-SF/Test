                Over the past decade, businesses have also become more challenging and business models more complex. To cope with them, financial reporting standards have become increasingly complex and require more professional judgement on the part of the preparers of financial statements. Examples include the accounting for business acquisitions, the fair value measurement of assets and revenue recognition of multi-element transactions.

<p>It is essential that the market remains confident in the level of transparency, integrity and quality of financial reporting. In response to this, we are commenced a Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme to enforce against poor financial reporting that leads to unreliable information and/or non-compliance with the prescribed accounting standards. </p>
